#### The week 3 independent project at Epicodus 06-14-2019

#### Author: Tamara Trefilova


## Description:

#### Create a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with the following exceptions:

#### Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
#### Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
#### Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't #### do that."
#### These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception should apply unless the #### second exception does, and the same with the second and third. So, for example, in the finished program,

#### The number 13 should be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
#### The number 21 should be replaced with "Boop".
#### The number 32 should be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
#### A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again.
